## About Make School Intensive
> Intensive is compariable to a week long "hackathon". I have one week to build something from scratch, start to finish. In this week I have to come up with an idea, create a paper wireframe for the idea, then create a digital demo, then code and ship my final project. At the end of the week I have to create a pitch powerpoint where I "pitch" my idea to my classmates and instructors. Intensive is a great way for me to add to my portfolio as well as push myself to my limits to create something amazing in a short amount of time. 

## About Color Me Perfect
Do you know what your undertone is? In my experience, many people do not. Knowing your undertone is extremely important as it helps you to determine what colors to wear to best flatter your skintone. This helps you present yourself in the best way possible. For people who wear makeup, it is especially important when considering what lipstick to wear. I set out to create a website that helps makeup enthusiasts find what shades look best on their lips, while keeping in mind inclusivity. When looking at other sources who did similar things, one thing that they lacked was enough options for everyone, taking into consideration both undertone and a wide array of skintones, making sure that everyone would be able to see their options.
